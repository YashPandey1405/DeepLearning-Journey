# üß† Artificial Neural Networks (ANN)

This repository contains my learning and implementation of Artificial Neural Networks ‚Äî the core foundation of Deep Learning. It extends my initial deep learning journey by applying neural network principles to more complex problems.

## ‚úÖ Topics Covered

- **ANN Architecture**: Input, hidden, and output layers
- **Weight Initialization**: Strategies to begin training effectively
- **Forward Propagation**: Passing input data through the network
- **Loss Functions**: Calculating the difference between predicted and actual values
- **Backward Propagation**: Updating weights using the loss gradient
- **Learning Rate Tuning**: Finding the optimal pace for model learning
- **Overfitting & Regularization**: Techniques like dropout and L2 regularization
- **Evaluation Metrics**: Accuracy, confusion matrix, and precision/recall

## üìä Implementation

- **Dataset**: (e.g., MNIST, IRIS, or custom dataset)
- **Model**: ANN built from scratch using NumPy
- **Goal**: Accurate classification of input data using a multi-layer perceptron (MLP)
